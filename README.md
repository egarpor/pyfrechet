*pyfréchet* is a Python module designed for the manipulation and analysis of data in metric spaces. It provides useful classes and methods for those looking to analyze non-standard data or develop new algorithms.

The package offers two essential building blocks for working with metric space-valued data: several implementations of metric spaces as subclasses of the `MetricSpace` class, and a dataframe-like class `MetricData` for holding a collection of metric space-valued data.

## Example

Currently, the package only implements regression methods with Euclidean predictors. Here's an example of how to use the package:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from pyfrechet.metric_spaces import MetricData
from pyfrechet.metric_spaces.sphere import Sphere
from pyfrechet.regression.knn import KNearestNeighbours

M = Sphere(dim=2)

X, y = random_data(n=300) # Generate random covariates in R^p and responses on the unit sphere S^2
y = MetricData(M, y) # Wrap the circle data in a MetricData object with the corresponding metric

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42) # The MetricData class is implemented with compatibility in mind, allowing to use it with other libraries from the Python ecosystem

# pyfréchet implements the widely-used scikit-learn estimator API for fitting and evaluating models
knn = KNearestNeighbours(n_neighbors=5).fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f'R2 = {knn.score(X_test, y_test)}')
```

## Another example 

As mentionned above, every estimator is a subclass of the `BaseEstimator` from `scikit-learn`, giving access to many model selection and validation tools. Consider for instance the selection of a kernel and bandwidth in a kernel regression problem. This can be done by grid-search cross validation using `scikit-learn`'s `GridSearchCV`[^5]

```python
# Standard imports as above ...

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from pyfrechet.metrics import mean_squared_error
from pyfrechet.regression.kernels import NadarayaWatson, gaussian, epanechnikov

M = Sphere(dim=2)

X, y = random_data(n=300) # Again, generate random covariates in R^p and responses on the unit sphere S^2

# Define the possible parameter values over which to do the search
param_grid = {
    'base_kernel': [gaussian, epanechnikov],
    'bw': np.logspace(-2, 0, 5)
}

# Define the Nadaraya-Watson estimator with parameters searched by cross-validation over the grid defined above
est = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=NadarayaWatson(),
    param_grid=param_grid,
    scoring=mean_squared_error
)
est.fit(X, y)

# This new estimator can be used as any parameters
est.predict(np.random.rand(p).reshape((1,-1)))

# And the best estimator can be extracted
est.best_estimator_
```

## Metric Spaces
The package supports the following metric spaces:
- Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$
- Spheres $S^{d-1}$
- 1D Wasserstein spaces with the $L_2$ distance[^4]
- Functions equipped with the Fisher-Rao Phase distance[^2]
- Correlation matrices equipped with the Frobenius distance

To add support for more metric spaces, simply create a subclass of the `MetricSpace` class and provide an implementation of the distance function and the weighted Fréchet mean in that space.

## Methods
The following regression methods are (partially) implemented:
- Global Fréchet regression[^1]
- Local Fréchet regression[^1] (only with $p=1$ predictor)
- Nadaraya-Watson 
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Random forest[^3] (with 4 different splitting schemes - 2x2)

## Testing

After installing the dependencies, you can run the test suite from the root of the project with the `test` rule:
```
make test
```
